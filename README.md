## Overview

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, and one area where significant progress can be made is in the recycling and repurposing of end-of-life aircraft components. This web application serves as a marketplace and dashboard to connect stakeholders and facilitate the recycling process.

The platform allows aircraft manufacturers and airlines to buy/identify components that are nearing the end of their useful life and arrange for their repurposing or recycling. Recycling facilities can also use the platform to identify sources of recycled materials, including both metals and non-metallic materials such as composites and plastics.

The dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of the key metrics and data related to the recycling and repurposing of end-of-life aircraft components. This includes information on the percentage of materials being recycled or repurposed, environmental impact metrics, and performance metrics.

## Features

- Database of aircraft parts with information on material composition, age, and condition.
- Marketplace functionality for manufacturers and airlines to buy/identify components for repurposing or recycling.
- Material identification and sourcing for recycling facilities.
- Dashboard with visualizations and metrics related to recycling and repurposing efforts.
